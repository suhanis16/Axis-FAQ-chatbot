Technology is leveraged to provide a seamless experience across channels. We constantly review multi-channel delivery services for improvements and engage with customers directly to understand their choices and preferences which in turn helps us to provide customers with greener options that are more convenient to adopt.\\nPhone Banking 24X7 Phone Banking channel \\nBranches/ Retail Asset Centers 2,904 domestic branch network \\nATMs/ Self service kiosks 12,743 ATMS\\nPoint of Sale (POS) terminals Around 0.3 million POS terminals Nearly 50,000 POS terminals enabled for NFC card acceptances \\nInternet Banking 3.71 million users \\nMobile Banking App 2.38 million users\\n\\nDigital Circle \\nAxis Digital Circle is our new channel which aims to create digital alternatives for physical banking transactions.

Currently, we have two Digital Circles live in Mumbai and Bengaluru.\\n\\nMulti-channel delivery highlights:\\nMobile banking:\\n• 2.38 million overall MB registrations (35% growth in Axis mobile users) \\n• `553 billion overall spends through MB (339% growth in spends) \\n• 53 million transaction count \\nInternet banking:\\n• 3.71 million overall IB netsecure registrations (23% growth in IB registrations)\\n• `950 billion overall spends through IB (16% growth in spends) \\n• 63 million transaction count\\nDigital channels: \\n• 0.33 million leads generated through the website across products \\n• 56% of overall leads generated for Personal Loans\\n\\nSocial media presence \\nSocial media is an important platform for us to connect and have a dialogue with our customers and other stakeholders. We actively use social media platforms to reach out to our customers for campaigns, new developments and achievements, among others. The platforms are also an avenue for our stakeholders to provide feedback and reach out to us directly.\\n\\nConsumer awareness and privacy \\nWe enable customers to make informed decisions about our products and services by providing them with right and transparent information. Product features and charges are informed to the customers during the transaction. The ‘Most Important Document’ contains terms and conditions including disclosures on any important disclaimers and grievance-redressal procedures. The Customer is required to read and sign on this important document along with the account opening / card application form. Where required by regulators or as an industry practice, the product labelling also includes a ‘risk rating’ of the product. Online tools are also available for customers to understand their eligibility, applicable interest rates and service charges for loan products such as home loans and car loans. SMS alerts are sent to customers when the charges or fees get triggered or levied in their account. Similarly, customers are made aware of free monthly ATM transactions available through SMS alerts. While requisite product and service information is provided to customers at the time of product purchase, it is critical for consumers in general to be aware of their rights and responsibilities in choosing the right products according to their risk profile and safeguarding against fraud. Our blog ‘Itsallaboutmoney’ provides a wealth of information to the public in general about various personal financial management concepts, safe banking, tips for choosing the right products, investment planning, consumer rights etc. Taxassist is another another web platform created to educate consumers about tax planning and saving. We also create awareness on safe banking through email alerts, SMS, ATM messages and websites. Information Security and Data Privacy are critical components of our operations. We continually implement measures guided by well-defined Information Systems Security Policies (ISSP) to meet regulatory requirements, satisfy voluntary industry standards, and adopt best practices towards managing information security and data privacy. All the applicable recommendations of the RBI Working Group issued on 29 April, 2011, relating to Information Security, Electronic Banking, Technology Risk Management and Cyber Frauds have been implemented. We have adopted and are certified for ISO 27001:2013 Information Security Management Systems and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 3.0. Periodic Vulnerability Risk Assessments are conducted across key assets to assess the potential risks and adopt mitigating strategies. State-of-the-art solutions are deployed for Data Leakage Protection, Information Rights Management, Mobile Device Management, Mobile Application Management, and Advanced Persistent Threat Management to ensure that the data and information is stored, accessed and transferred in a controlled and secure environment. All electronic data and information transmitted to third-party agencies is stringently monitored and data encryptions are used to secure the use of such data. Employees are periodically trained on information security policies and measures, and they are required to complete a mandatory e-learning module on information security.\\nSafe Banking\\nTo disseminate the information on safe banking in an entertaining and fun way, we have created small videos which are tales about two friends Jai and Vicky. The videos illustrate real-life situations and how one should avoid common pitfalls that can lead to fraud. The safe banking tips include precautions to be taken while using an ATM, making payments through cards, and responding to suspicious emails and phone calls. The videos can be accessed through the blog itsallaboutmoney or through our YouTube channel. The videos were also widely circulated through WhatsApp mobile messaging app.\\nSimple Process \\nOur ‘Simple Process’ approach is designed to make banking and money management exceptionally easy across all behaviours and touch points. We empower our customers to transact using convenient, secure and cost-effective self-service and digital channels. Customers are offered bundled pricing options that are more transparent as monthly charges are declared at the outset. Process improvements under project ‘Pratham’ and other initiatives are pursued through the efficiencies offered by our new banking systems and more streamlined procedures such as paperless and remote account opening processes.\\n\\n2015-16 Highlights: \\nInsta Kit activation alert for customers on the registered mobile number\\nCustomer onboarding on digital platforms \\nReminders to customers to use the mobile app feature for requesting cheque books \\nReal-time offer-related pop ups made available on the mobile app \\nMobile number registration of joint account holders is made available for all new and existing customers for transaction alerts and One Time Passwords \\nProcess automation, lean documentation, and SLA monitoring and alignment for Forex-related processes (Inward Remittance, Outward Remittance, Retail Inward Remittance)\\neTDS certificate made available through Phone Banking and shared through the customers’ registered email ID \\nAadhaar seeding through Phone Banking made available \\nProcess automation, approval management system, and charge and document simplification for International Trade offerings (Foreign Letter of Credit, Buyer’s Credit, Import Bills, Export Bills) \\nOnline booking of Demand Draft and collection at any Axis Bank branch \\nStatement password made easy to remember - multiple and easy passwords enabled for customers to open e-statements \\nProcess automation, approval management system, and document simplification for Domestic Trade offerings (Inland Letter of Credit, Inland Bank Guarantee, Inward Bills of Collection, Outward Bills of Collection)\\n\\nCustomer service and engagement \\nOur aim is to provide unparalleled customer service. ‘PROGRESS’, \\nour Customer Service Credo,\\nProactive in approach \\nRight for the customer \\nOwn the solution \\nGo deeper \\nRemove the jargon \\nError free \\nSimplify \\nServe enthusiastically\\ndefines the basic tenets of customer service that we believe in and aspire to live daily. Our Customer Service Credo We continue to pursue our journey of ‘customer service excellence’ through various initiatives that reinforce a service culture across levels. The ‘PROGRESS’ service culture framework empowers people by creating multiple listening posts for capturing feedback, developing programs and enablers, which aid employees in delivering a differentiated customer service, creating a network of Service Guardians and Ambassadors, and felicitating the employees who live the values of our Customer Credo in their daily work through rewards and recognition programs. Focused programs are run to promote and address various aspects of customer service. ‘My Customer’ surveys help the frontline teams to provide valuable insights to understand the factors that impact our service standard, and ascertain our strengths and areas of opportunities. The ‘Axis One View’ Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool provides a 360-degree view of the entire liability relationship of the customer in a single screen. We have strengthened the CRM platform with ‘Customer Profiler’ and ‘Customer Feedback Mechanism’ to capture all customer interactions and feedback, and build unique customer profiles, which enable us to service customers through personalised offerings. To assess the customer experience and quality of service, structured mystery shopping audits are conducted and the outcome is analysed to address the service gaps and identify further opportunities for improvement. During the year, we launched focused programs to capture instant customer feedback post their transaction and support the branches through weekly scores and progress feedback towards achieving perfection across six key servicing parameters. Customers have various channels through which they can reach out to us. Customer helplines and email details are provided on the Bank’s website. Customers can lodge their complaint on an online complaint management system. They can also report their grievances at the branches. All the complaints are monitored centrally. The TAT and escalation matrix are well defined to ensure the complaints are resolved in the minimum time possible. A three-level escalation matrix has been established for domestic and overseas customers. The analysis of customer complaints is done in a proactive manner and feedback is provided to business teams to ensure that appropriate mitigation measures are taken. The assessment of the quality of complaint closures is undertaken on a sample basis, to highlight process adherence gaps by branches and backend processing teams. The customer service and grievance redressal initiatives are reviewed at the highest level by the Customer Service Committee of the Board. At the executive level, the Standing Committee on Customer Service reviews customer service and grievance redressal initiatives. Customer engagement also falls within the purview of Standing Committee meetings wherein customers share their feedback. Supported by various product, process and service initiatives undertaken, we were able to reduce the complaints ratio (per thousand accounts) by 4%.\\n\\nCustomer satisfaction \\nWe conduct an annual Customer Satisfaction Survey (CSAT) to assess the perception and expectations of customers on various aspects of the Bank’s product, services and brand. At the transaction level, the Customer Transaction Survey (CTS) is an ongoing survey that is conducted with a sample of customers to understand their experience with different aspects of the Bank. The insights from the surveys are discussed in the Service Quality Council meetings. \\nSME Focus\\n We are committed to the growth of the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector and offer a wide range of fast-track and customised products designed to meet the needs of the sector. Currently, we operate from 51 SME Centres and 9 SME Cells across the country to service customers effectively covering around more than 1,500 branches. Continual efforts are made to evolve new products and processes that will help in better serving the SME sector. “SME Dealer Power” launched during the year offers a comprehensive financing facility to the dealers of various companies in the country for efficient management of working capital and other business requirements. Another newly launched product “Exim Power” offers financing facilities to SMEs engaged in export/import activities and showcases our commitment towards the “Make in India” initiative. We have also adopted industrial cluster based financing as an important strategy towards ensuring manufacturing credit flow in the SME sector. As part of this initiative, important clusters have been identified across various sectors and plans have been developed to focus more on these identified clusters in the coming years We also support the SME sector growth through non-financial services focused on knowledge-based initiatives. ‘Evolve’ is a knowledge series that aims to provide a platform for SMEs to gain knowledge on new SME growth opportunities. The workshops involve expert speakers who provide insights on pertinent topics for SME sector growth. During the year, we expanded the ‘Evolve’ program to 40 cities across the country covering nearly 4,000 participants. This initiative is also a step towards further facilitating and contributing to the “Make in India” initiative. \\nFinancial Inclusion & Literacy \\nFinancial inclusion is a key enabler for inclusive growth and is pursued by the Government of India as a ‘national priority’. We have aligned our financial inclusion agenda with the four key pillars of financial inclusion promoted by the Government of India – savings, credit, remittances, and insurance and pension. Our endeavour is to serve the excluded sections of society in a cost-effective manner through specialised products and services designed for them. Financial literacy is an integral part of our financial inclusion agenda and aims to empower various sections of society with knowledge on the basics of savings and other personal financial management aspects. Promoting savings through the formal banking system A basic savings account provides a banking identity to the excluded and under-served sections of society and acts as a vital channel for them to access various financial services and social benefits, thus contributing to inclusive growth. We leverage our network of 587 rural branches, Business Correspondent network and technology to serve the financial inclusion customer base. Aadhar-based paperless eKYC is deployed towards ensuring a hassle-free account opening process. We also actively support the Government of India’s endeavour towards completing the comprehensive financial inclusion project ‘Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana’ (PMJDY).\\nProviding customised credit services \\n‘Axis Sahyog’ is our micro-loan initiative to empower women groups to undertake income generation activities. Women form Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) to access micro-loans. Financial literacy is imparted to women groups to ensure that they have a basic understanding of concepts like savings, interest rates, credit score and so on. Women beneficiaries and their spouses are also covered through insurance to manage emergency situations. The initiative is currently active in the seven states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Jharkhand. We have tied up with Business Correspondents to extend similar micro-loans in the state of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. We also provide credit-related services to Non-Banking Financial Companies and Microfinance Institutions, which further cater to the excluded sections of society. To enable a secure and speedier onboarding and disbursal process, we have launched a new tablet-based Loan Origination system for Microfinance business. The application includes different modules for the onboarding of villages by conducting village surveys, and onboarding of applicants by conducting group trainings and tests, and completing the disbursement. The tablet application is integrated with our underwriting hub for real-time approvals/rejections based on bureau checks and underwriting rules. Agriculture lending is a key focus area for us. We have a wide range of products that cater to the specific needs of the rural and agricultural sector like cultivation needs, tractors, cattle, commodity storage and contract farming. We also engage with the farming community through agriculture expert talks to enable them to increase their productivity and earnings. We have created specialised products to address the needs of housing for economically weaker sections, and rural and semi-urban areas. The ‘Asha Home Loan’ caters to the Low Income Group/Economically Weaker Sections of society by providing them loans for affordable housing. During the year, we have also launched Rural & Semi Urban (RUSU) Home loans, a Home loan product specifically for Rural and Semi-Urban customers.\\nNGOs as Business Correspondent Partners \\nAxis Bank Foundation conducts livelihood programs with a specific focus on women empowerment. The women beneficiaries generally form Self Help Groups (SHGs) to pursue livelihood activities. ABF programs are spread across different districts in the country wherein some areas there is nominal or no banking facility. To enable the beneficiaries and SHGs to avail banking services, we have partnered with entities such as ABF Partner NGOs to deliver basic banking services under the Business Correspondent model. Currently, we have enrolled four NGOs as our BC partners and have opened basic savings accounts for 600 members of the SHGs to avail banking facilities through these BCs.\\nRemittance and payment services \\nOur easy-access remittance and payment services are designed to provide easy and secure domestic money transfers and especially help the migrant population to send money to their dependents in villages. The remittances can be made in three modes: cash to account, account to account, and account to cash. To ensure a wide outreach of such services, we leverage technology through mobile-enabled banking services in partnership with Suvidhaa Infoserve, Novopay Solutions Pvt Ltd. and Idea Mobile Commerce Services Ltd. The remittance and payment services are powered by a network of Business Correspondents (BC) and Customer Service Points (CSP). CSPs also serve the customers through small ticket payment services such as mobile and Direct-to-home (DTH) recharges, utility bill payments and loan re-payments. Direct credit and disbursal of Government benefits such as wages, pensions, subsidies etc. promote transparent governance and help in reducing slippages, thus ensuring that deserving beneficiaries avail such benefits in a safe and timely manner. We support Direct/Electronic Benefit Transfer schemes across 18 districts in the country. We secured the mandate to credit and disburse Social Security Payments (pensions), wages under the National Rural Employment Generation Act (NREGA) and subsidies like LPG subsidy across various states. The beneficiary accounts are linked to benefit schemes through Aadhar-enabled bank accounts. The beneficiaries can avail disbursals in cash through the Aadhar authentication mechanism after benefits are credited in their accounts. The disbursals are supported by a network of BCs and CSPs who are provided with micro-ATMs (biometric handheld devices) to facilitate door-step banking.\\nInsurance and pension schemes \\nThe Government of India has introduced various social security schemes in the Insurance and Pension sectors for all citizens, especially targeting the poor and the under-privileged. The two insurance schemes – Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyothi Bima Yojana (life cover) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (accidental death and disability cover) – provide affordable insurance cover while the pension scheme Atal Pension Yojana is targeted at people in the unorganised sector who are currently not covered through formal pension schemes. We are authorised to enrol customers under these schemes. To popularise these schemes and to enrol a large number of people, we have conducted various camps and have sent messages to customers. During the year, we were able to enrol over one million people for these schemes.\\nFinancial Literacy \\nFinancial literacy is an important enabler for achieving comprehensive financial inclusion. Our financial literacy initiatives are aimed to create awareness on basic financial concepts like the need and importance of savings, insurance, investments for future, pension planning, loans, credit limits and repayments, which will enable people to better manage their personal finances and make informed decisions. Financial Literacy Camps (FLC) are conducted in rural areas using the broad-based financial literacy module developed by the Reserve Bank of India. Hand-held projectors, financial literacy posters, diaries and other tools are used to make the sessions interesting and easy to understand. During the year, we conducted 7,210 FLCs reaching out to approximately 68,000 people. Disseminating financial literacy is also a key component of our extension of the banking services arrangement with Business Correspondents (BCs). ‘Train the trainer’ program is conducted for BCs towards this end. We also conduct various health camps and agriculture talks in the vicinity of our branches to engage with local communities. During the year, we conducted over 500 such camps.\"),\n",
